							Our products are a vehicle for questioning ideas about the role of tradition, the nature of family, monogamy, polygamy, relationships between men and women, between women and their children, and between women and other women-underscoring the critical problems and the possible resolves. In one way or another, our products endlessly explode the limits of tradition. Our products pit the expression of identity against the loss of individuality. They also become part of a group that establishes identity in a general way, but also takes the emphasis away from the individual.
